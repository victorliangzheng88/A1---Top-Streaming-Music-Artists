# A1---Top-Streaming-Music-Artists

This project demonstrates how to read in a file of the top streaming music artist in spotify and convert those data into the format of the number of times the artist appeared on the list and also sorted it by their names alphabetically.

My approach to meet the requirement is that:

First, use linkedlist to read in the data in the file. The reason that I use linked list is that the operation with linked list is much easier and furthermore, it can grow and shrink during run time,
which makes insertion and deletion much easier.
